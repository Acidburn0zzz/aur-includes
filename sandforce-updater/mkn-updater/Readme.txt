Before upgrading the firmware, be sure to back up important data 
to a separate storage medium. Complete data loss may occur as a 
result of the firmware update process!

1. After downloading the firmware installation package, extract 
the zip file.  If you are running Windows OS, browse to the 
extracted folder and launch Mushkin_FieldUpdater.exe with admin-
istrative privileges. If SF_FieldUpdater is not launched with 
administrative privileges, the Chronos SSD(s) will not be dis-
covered by the updater.  If running Linux, launch 
Mushkin_FieldUpdater_v1.3_FC14-32Bit or Mushkin_FieldUpdater_v1.3_FC12-64Bit.

2. Once the updater application is launched, the Chronos SSD(s) 
should be discovered in the window. Check the box beside the 
drive you want to update. Select the button "Update Firmware" on 
the bottom left and browse for the MKN_FW_5-0-4.ffp file.

3. The updater should find the fw file, click the fw file to 
highlight it then click "Open" at the bottom right of the window.
You will then received a warning message.  Click "Proceed" to 
continue flashing the firmware.

4. The system may automatically reboot after the firmware update 
is complete.  If it does not reboot after 5 minutes.  Shut the 
machine down and restart.

Congratulations, your Chronos SSD is now updated!
